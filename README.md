# stripe-metadata-wordpress-plugin

Woocommerce Stripe Gateway plugin doesn't initially support the ability for you to control what metadata you can pass in stripe, so this plugin adds a filter hook to give the ability to add data from the Woocommerce Order Object. 

Also special thanks to Andrew Norcross for outlining the boilerplate of this plugin.
